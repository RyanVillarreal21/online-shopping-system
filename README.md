# online-shopping-system

A GUI designed to emulate an online shopping system. The application allowed for three types of users: regular customers, premium customers, or suppliers. The customers would be able to select various items before viewing their carts and making an order. The customers also have the ability to either view any current orders they have or view their entire order history. One of the abilities of the supplier is to monitor the inventory of the items in the store. The other features of a supplier is to monitor the status of orders. The supplier will update the status of an order to "Ready" once they have verified the items are in stock. Next, the supplier will then update the order to "Shipped" once the order has been shipped. Collaborated in a team of four for the application.

Designed wth Java in Eclipse IDE
